# HiAGM: Hierarchy-Aware Global Model for Hierarchical Text Classification
This repository implements the hierarchy-aware structure encoders for mutual interaction between label space and text features. 
This work has been accepted as the long paper '[Hierarchy-Aware Global Model for Hierarchical Text Classification](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.104/)' in ACL 2020. The dataset splits of NYTimes (New York Times) and WoS (Web of Science) are proposed in this repository.


### Hierarchy-Aware Global Model
The hierarchy-aware global model improves the conventional text classification model with prior knowledge of the predefined hierarchical structure.
The project folder consists of following parts:
+ config: config files (json format)
+ data: data dir, could be changed in config file (with sample data)
+ data_modules: Dataset / DataLoader / Collator / Vocab
+ helper: Configure / Hierarchy_Statistic / Logger / Utils
+ models: StructureModel / EmbeddingLayer / TextEncoder / TextPropagation (HiAGM-TP) / Multi-Label Attention (HiAGM-LA)
+ train_modules: Criterions / EvaluationMetrics / Trainer

#### Hierarchy-Aware Structure Encoder
+ Bidirectional TreeLSTM: weighted_tree_lstm.py & tree.py
+ Hierarchy-GCN: graphcnn.py

### Setup
+ Python >= 3.6
+ torch >= 0.4.1
+ numpy >= 1.17.4

### Preprocess
#### data_modules.preprocess
+ transform to json format file {'token': List[str], 'label': List[str]}
+ clean stopwords
+ [RCV1-V2](http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/jmlr/papers/volume5/lewis04a/lyrl2004_rcv1v2_README.htm): The preprocess code could refer to the [repository of reuters_loader](https://github.com/ductri/reuters_loader).
+ [NYTimes](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19) & [WoS](https://github.com/kk7nc/HDLTex): data.preprocess_nyt & data.preprocess_wos. 
Please download the origin datasets and then use these codes to preprocess for HTC. 

#### Prior Probability
+ helper.hierarchical_statistic
+ Note that first change the Root.child List 
+ calculate the prior probability between parent-child pair in train dataset


### Train
```bash
python train.py config/gcn-rcv1-v2.json
```
+ optimizer -> train.set_optimizer: default torch.optim.Adam
+ learning rate decay schedule callback -> train_modules.trainer.update_lr
+ earlystop callback -> train.py 
+ Hyper-parameters are set in config.train
